# About
Run-CMC is short for "Run a Curated Music Collage". It is a full-stack application designed to allow users to use album art from their favorite artist to create their own works of art and at the same time discover new music. As a user you can view the most popular user creations, click on album art, and get details about the artist and release date information. As a registered user you can create a profile, create CMC artwork, and click on individual album art and be taken to spotify to listen to that album. In addition, a registered user can comment, and favorite creations. This application was built using Java, Springboot, MySql, Material Design Bootsrap, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Spotify Web API and the Filestack API.
